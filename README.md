## Resources

For the majority of the lesson, it is suggested that work is carried out by students on a Raspberry Pi in pairs. Each pair should have access to the standard equipment described below. In addition, it is suggested that you have your own teacher setup connected to a projector screen for demonstration purposes.

- A Raspberry Pi per pair
- A NOOBS SD card per Raspberry Pi (with an up-to-date Raspbian installed)
- A keyboard and mouse connected to each Raspberry Pi
- A monitor connected to each Raspberry Pi
- A micro USB power adaptor
- All necessary cables

See [raspberrypi.org/downloads](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) to download NOOBS/Raspbian and see the [NOOBS setup guide](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/) for help with installation.
